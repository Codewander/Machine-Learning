# Machine-Learning
I used Rational Rhapsody MDA tool to reverse engineer David Miller neural2d neural 
network project (see: https://github.com/davidrmiller/neural2d) and generated the 
logical view of the system (i.e. class diagram). I color-coded the classes for better
visulaization.
The .bmp file is too big to be shown by github. Download it and open it on your machine. 
Notice the "has_a"(inheritance) and "is_a"(composition, aggregation) relationaships: 
So the Net has Layer(s) which has Neuron(s). Also notice the Connection with to and from Neurons...
