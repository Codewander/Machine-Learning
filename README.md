# Machine-Learning
I used Rational Rhapsody MDA tool to reverse engineer David Miller's neural2d neural network project (see: https://github.com/davidrmiller/neural2d) and generated the logical view of the system (i.e. class diagram). I color-coded the classes for better visualization. Notice the "has_a"(inheritance) and "is_a"(composition, aggregation) relationships: So the Net has Layer(s) which has Neuron(s). Also notice the Connection with to and from Neurons...
